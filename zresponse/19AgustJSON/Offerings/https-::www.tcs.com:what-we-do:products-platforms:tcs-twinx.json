Current experience-led decisioning and implementation techniques are insufficient to drive continuous adaptation in the face of deep uncertainties.","TCS TwinX™ enables organizations to experiment with and evaluate multiple business strategies at scale to view the results prior to real-world execution. Enterprises can leverage what-if and if-what analyses powered by a self-learning controller which enables continuous optimization of the enterprise and allows them to address macro as well as micro trends."]},{"heading":"How we help our clients","content":["Leverage cutting-edge research on artificial intelligence (AI) and actor model of computation","TCS TwinXTM enables organizations to construct their own enterprise digital twins by modeling and experimenting with key enterprise entities including customers, products, processes, and resources. This digital twin-based simulator helps construct hypothesis, model entities and test business decision outcomes in the virtual A/B testing mode, enabling organizations to analyze, adapt and transform themselves towards achieving holistic business goals. The platform creates a virtual and faithful representation of the organization based on key business entities, their interrelationships, and the impact of external forces on them including competitor movement, natural calamities, and unforeseen global emergencies such as the pandemic.","The outcome: An accurate insight into the future evolution of enterprise systems based on entities’ behavioral changes and their situational responses. This helps to accurately predict and simulate the future behavior of entities and the system as a whole.","Faster time-to-market through virtual testing","Reduced revenue leakage by identifying fraudulent attempts","Enhanced CX through hyper personalization","Evidence- and simulation-based business decision making","Faithful replicas of enterprise entities","Simulation of multiple business scenarios"]},{"heading":"Our Solutions","content":["Helping organizations achieve multiple business benefits.","01.

Telstra’s T25 initiative is centered around modernizing and enhancing its entire network infrastructure.","The primary focus of the transformation is migration from legacy network systems to cutting-edge solutions like 5G, ensuring faster, high speed, and more reliable services for customers not only in the city but also in the suburbs and rural areas.","To ensure the success of this ambitious transformation, Telstra has partnered with TCS banking on our deep expertise in wireless microwave design, which is crucial for 5G implementation and to support other advanced wireless solutions deliveries."]},{"heading":"Challenge","content":["Telstra wanted to simplify its network transformation process.","In the fiercely competitive telecommunications landscape, Telstra sought to upgrade its network infrastructure while maintaining nationwide coverage. The challenge was not only to deploy new technologies like 5G, but also to phase out older systems such as 3G within a tight timeframe of 60 months.","This transition demanded meticulous planning and execution of design deliveries for microwave transport planning and design (MTPD) that meet Telstra's stringent standards. Additionally, incorporating products from multiple microwave vendors further complicated the transition process."]},{"heading":"Solution","content":["TCS, with its expertise in wireless domains, emerged as a preferred partner to assist Telstra in navigating this complex transition.","TCS’ technical prowess, when combined with the swift training and upskilling of the team working on this project on Telstra's specific processes, workflows, and tools, enabled a seamless transition for all the stakeholders involved.","By collaborating with various business units within Telstra, TCS facilitated the alignment of implementation planning with the company's objectives. TCS' team, now certified by Telstra across a range of domain-related competencies, took charge of critical activities such as as-built, high-level design (HLD) as-built contractors QC, and detailed design, that were essential for the success of the microwave transport planning and design (MTPD) delivery."]},{"heading":"Outcomes","content":[]},{"heading":"The implementation marked significant milestones in Telstra's network modernization efforts.","content":["The collaboration between Telstra and TCS yielded remarkable results. The high-level designs crucial for the closure of 3G networks were successfully completed, laying the groundwork for a smooth transition.","Over 90 sites underwent a transformation from the network black box to the new devices of a microwave major OEM, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity. TCS' involvement extended beyond design to encompass crucial areas like 225 as-built design, 175 HLD as-built contractor quality check, 5 detailed design, and 15 network management design for connectivity between fiber node till last mile site.","This comprehensive approach fortified Telstra's network infrastructure, positioning it for future growth and innovation in the dynamic telecommunications landscape.","Strength in numbers"]},{"heading":"Strength in numbers","content":["90 sites underwent complete transformation","225-as-built design","175 HLD as-built contractor quality check","5 detailed design","15 network management design"]},{"cards":[]}]}

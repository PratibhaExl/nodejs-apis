--> Authentication and Authorization 
   --> Authentication : It is the process of verifying who as user is (who you are)
   --> Authorization : It is the process of verifying what they have access to (what you are allowed to do)
     ---> ** JSON Web Token (JWT) :- JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties because they can be signed. Every time the token is new so it is more secure.
        -> How  JWT Work 

          Client  ----> Login Request   ---> Server
                  <----  Signed Token   <----
        
          Client  -----> Data Request +Signed Token  ---> Server
                  <------ response <---------------
        -> Structure of JWT 
            -> First section of the JWT is the header , which is a Base64-encoded string , which contains the hashing algorithm, which was used to generate the sign and the type of the token.
            -> Second section is the payload that containe the JSON object of user data.
        -> Who you are and 
        -> That it is actually you accessing the application 
        -> npm install jsonwebtoken --save 
        -> from client side we send the token through headers
          Bearer tokennnnn
        -> File uploading in express js 
           -> multer :- with the help of multer middleware or module we can acheive the file uploading.
              npm install multer --save
        -> cors :- It is a third party middleware which allow all the cross origin requests.
           npm install cors --save 
          index.js 
          import cors from 'cors';
          app.use(cors());

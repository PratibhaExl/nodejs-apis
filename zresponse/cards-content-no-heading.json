We believe agentic AI software and humans will symbiotically enhance each other’s autonomous capabilities. The application of this interplay is being explored across the CSP value chain from customer engagement (core commerce) to service and resource management layers.","The rise of ubiquitous connectivity is ensuring seamless access to even the most remote locations, unlocking new applications in multi-access edge computing and edge-driven ecosystems. In parallel, enterprise AI and GenAI are enriching the use cases with federated inference capabilities and enabling hybrid cloud operations that integrate edge environments, fueling innovation at scale.","The design of new network topology and protocols required to support GenAI systems will spawn a full set of radically new use cases for the entire network lifecycle – from design to in-life monitoring. The inclusion of non-terrestrial networks and multi-orbit satellite communication will add a new dimension of cross-domain OSS capabilities to manage these infrastructures.","Key developments in the telecom landscape","These trends are poised to redefine the CSP ecosystem in 2025 and beyond.","1. Evolution of platform architectures","Many communication service providers are reprioritizing investments in satellite communications to enhance remote access and provide reliable backhaul as well as backup scenarios for 5G and fiber deployment.","Additionally, autonomous network operations will leverage AI and machine learning to self-optimize networks, ensuring efficient traffic management, resource allocation, and seamless cross domain management and orchestrations. This sustainable satellite communications approach is vital for supporting emerging technologies, which demand dynamic and intelligent resource management.","The rich set of possibilities (read use cases) will continue to push CSPs to continuously assess their OSS and network management systems. The ability to develop platform-like capabilities will be key in transitioning toward higher maturity in autonomous networks and operations, as outlined in TM Forum’s maturity models.","2. Getting data-ready for AI","The biggest factor that will bridge the chasm between the hype and reality of AI will be the ability to provide data that is fit for consumption by the AI-ML models. Traditional data readiness and management methods for business intelligence and analytics are insufficient for use in AI models. Standards-defining organizations, telcos, and technology companies are focusing on developing architecture matters of the data fabric and metadata and domain ontology maps and models. Data governance in distributed and federated setups using data mesh operating models is key to implementing use cases that cut across traditionally siloed processes in the enterprise.","3. Redesigning human-centric interactions, process workflows, and collaboration","The evolution from AI assistants and co-pilots to AI agents and agentic architecture is fundamentally reshaping human-machine interactions in telecom operations. AI-driven proofs of concept (POCs) and pilots are transforming functions such as contact center automation, network operations center workflows, and field deployments for fiber, 5G, and mobile private networks.","Additionally, multi-modal immersive interfaces are redefining traditional user interface experiences. Concepts of distinct systems of records and systems of intelligence and insight are converging as the pursuit toward higher levels of autonomy blurs the conventional behaviors of human-machine interactions for decision making. The proliferation of APIs in the enterprise (and cross-enterprise) has triggered the need for further standardization (such as model context protocol in AI-enabled applications being described as USB-C port for AI applications). The promise of network APIs and CAMARA APIs will accelerate this demand along with monetization pressures.","4. Designing and building secure, fit-for-purpose infrastructure for AI workload","Interactions, data flow patterns, data volume, latency sensitivity, intensity of compute, and network resilience (lossiness) for AI systems are different from that of traditional enterprise systems. They even differ for AI-based systems based on location i.e. edge based or centralized (on-premises or private-public regional cloud DCs).","Network topologies such as flat high-radix topologies for low-diameter networks will need to be introduced to replace or augment traditional hierarchical trees such as leaf and spine models. Supporting protocols such as remote direct memory access (RDMA), RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE), InfiniBand, and GPU-aware protocols will inevitably be introduced to traditional ones such as TCP, IP, and Ethernet. Sovereign AI infrastructures of CSPs will be the likely candidates to be first on the block to trial these.","A future shaped by AI","Strategic investments in AI, security, and next-gen networks will define the future of telecom.","As these trends converge, IT service providers with deep expertise in AI, security, connectivity, and customer experiences will play a crucial role in guiding telcos through this transformation.","Autonomous networks and GenAI will enhance network performance and efficiency, while improved customer experiences will drive higher satisfaction and loyalty.","In 2025, CXOs of telecom companies will prioritize their efforts and capital in the benefits these technologies promise to deliver. The future of telecom is being built today; those who embrace these innovations will lead the charge in shaping a more connected, intelligent, and resilient communications landscape.","About the author","Leveraging AI implementation in communications and media","TCS-TM Forum Knowledge Report: Setting up Telecoms LLMs","Generative AI-Powered Next Generation Telcos","Toward a Net-zero Future: How CSPs are Committing to Green Tech","Transformation starts here","Want to go beyond traditional boundaries?","We use cookies to give you the best possible experience on our website."]}},{"text":"How emerging technologies are redefining telecom CFO’s role","href":"https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/industries/communications-media-information-services/white-paper/emerging-technologies-redefine-telecom-cfo-role","pagecontent":{"title":"How emerging technologies are redefining telecom CFO’s role","metaDescription":"From analytics, AI, and automation to risk management, learn how emerging technologies and human insight are bolstering the CFO’s role in the telecom industry.","content":["Going beyond finance: A new role for the telecom CFO","Global Head – Sales and Solutioning, Communications, Media, and Information Services, TCS","Consulting Partner, Communications, Media and Information Services, TCS","The CFO’s role, reimagined","The modern-day telecom CFO has evolved beyond traditional financial management.","Today's CFOs balance core financial responsibilities with strategic leadership, actively shaping growth strategies and identifying new revenue opportunities. This transformation is being accelerated by advanced technologies that provide predictive insights for informed decision-making.","This evolution is particularly evident in the telecom industry.","The sector's unique challenges—large-scale infrastructure investments, massive transaction volumes, and rapidly changing consumer demands—create an environment where AI and machine learning can deliver exceptional value. However, the human element remains crucial, with the CFO’s judgment and leadership complementing technological capabilities.","From backward-looking to forward-focused","Telecom CFOs today are bringing about a change in perspective – shifting from retrospective analysis to forward-looking strategies.","They now make critical capital expenditure decisions on next-gen network rollouts, monitor the return on investment (RoI), partner with IT on strategic technology investments, balance short-term efficiency with long-term technological advancement, rely on real-time data and continuous forecasting, and adopt preventative approaches to get it right, right from the get-go.","Transforming decision-making","AI and automation are fundamentally changing how telecom finance functions operate, including routine tasks such as invoice processing, transaction matching, and automated fraud detection. Finance teams aim for higher job satisfaction as staff time is redirected to value-added analysis and strategic activities. AI capabilities are also helping teams analyze vast datasets to identify patterns and enable faster decision-making, resulting in shortened monthly reporting and closure cycles that produce real-time insights. Predictive algorithms also help improve forecasting accuracy by analyzing internal data alongside external factors.","Tackling industry challenges","Automation and analytics benefit CFOs across different sectors. In telecom, AI and analytics deliver value in two critical areas:","Capital expenditure optimization: AI-driven planning can reduce capex by 10–15%, as machine learning models analyze network usage and demographic data to prioritize infrastructure investments and direct resources to projects with the highest returns.","Customer retention: Telecom companies leverage predictive analytics to identify subscribers at risk of churn, enabling finance teams to collaborate with marketing and customer service on targeted retention strategies, which, through advanced analytics, can reduce the churn by up to 15%, representing significant revenue protection.","Securing returns on investment","It is no surprise that telecom CFOs are rapidly adopting AI—the returns are compelling. Automation reduces staffing needs and accelerates reporting, while predictive analytics uncover new revenue streams and protect existing ones. More accurate forecasting improves capital management and investment decisions, helping meet or exceed ROI expectations.","The human element remains essential","While technology transforms the role, successful telecom CFOs recognize that AI is an enabler, not a replacement.","Human judgment provides context and interpretation that AI cannot. Finance professionals can focus on tasks that require creativity, ethics, and strategic thinking, complemented by new technical roles alongside traditional finance positions. This creates an optimal approach that combines the analytical power AI offers with human intuition and leadership.","Today's telecom CFO is a strategic leader who leverages technology to anticipate challenges, identify opportunities, and drive growth.","By combining human expertise with AI-powered insights, CFOs can:","● Predict market trends and customer behavior","● Optimize resource allocation","● Proactively mitigate risks","● Guide major investment decisions with greater confidence","The most successful telecom companies will be those where CFOs embrace this dual role—utilizing technology while providing the human leadership and strategic vision that algorithms alone cannot offer.","This balanced approach positions telecom organizations to make better decisions, respond more quickly to market shifts, and deliver superior customer experiences in an increasingly competitive landscape.","About the authors","Technology trends 2025: Reshaping the future of telecom","Leveraging AI implementation in communications and media","Generative AI-Powered Next Generation Telcos","TCS AI for Business Study — Key Findings for CMI Services","Transformation starts here","Want to go beyond traditional boundaries?","We use cookies to give you the best possible experience on our website."]}},{"text":"Leveraging AI implementation in communications and media","href":"https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/industries/communications-media-information-services/white-paper/leveraging-ai-implementation-communication-media","pagecontent":{"title":"Leveraging AI implementation in communications and media","metaDescription":"Large telecom companies are aggressively adopting AI-enabled technologies to become AI-native organizations.","content":["AI Native Enterprises in Communications, Media and Information Services – a Strategic Imperative","CTO, Communications, Media & Information Services","Industry Advisor, CTO office, Communications, Media & Information Services","Leveraging the power of “ Thoughtful AI implementation “ for communications, media and information services","Few technology advancements have sparked the public interest and imagination like Generative AI.","The latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) show promise for business in terms of revenue growth and leading-edge innovation. In addition, AI offers enormous potential to create new jobs and enhance human capabilities, making AI a strategic imperative for businesses today. The new generation of digital services required by cross-industry enterprise ecosystems and value chains will be characterized by real-time behaviors and capacity to be fully integrated. This calls for the ability to manage higher speed of data traffic and greater computing resource requirements beyond the current levels offered by hybrid cloud and networks.","Competition is keen in Communications, Media and Information Services","The Communications, Media and Information Services (CMI) industry is at the crossroads of fierce competition.","Traditional revenue streams are plateauing or at decline, customer expectations are soaring, and investments in disruptive technologies like 5G, 6G, edge computing, etc. are demanding compelling business case and innovative solutions. In this dynamic landscape, CMI enterprises can leverage the power of AI to unlock potential value across products, services, and operations to become “AI-first” enterprises. At the same time, heeding market dynamics and economic circumstances, they are aiming for further operational efficiency and optimization.","The telecommunications industry is experiencing a massive transformation with increased adoption of AI-enabled technologies. Telcos are moving from network-driven to software-driven models, evolving toward becoming “techcos.” More and more telecom companies are inherently designing products, systems and services integrated with AI-capabilities to become “AI-native” organizations. This is a game changer in yielding core product differentiation, new revenue-generating models, and delivering superior customer experiences with improved operational efficiencies for telecom companies. There is a strategic shift in the architecture as the prospects and potential of adoption of AI (including GenAI) gets deeper into the core commerce business and infrastructure/network systems and operations as communications service providers (CSPs) move from digital telco service providers (DSPs) into the AI-driven and AI-native telco era.","The C-suite champions of telecom companies are laying down, or have laid down already, a whole-of-business AI strategy, where the business units integrate Data & AI for improved customer experience, network resilience, employee engagement, and financial outcomes, and most often, a central Data & AI function ensures strategic and cross-company AI opportunities achieve productive business outcomes. To enable this, the Data & AI function is empowered to redefine and reimagine how data and AI can be leveraged with multi-year investment, dedicated leadership, executive support, and company-wide consistency, balancing long-term benefits with short-term gains.","CMI leaders believe AI has the capability to deliver more highly personalized, proactive, and value-added experiences across the customer journey in a way that drives competitive differentiation and builds long-term loyalty. Most CMI executives expect AI’s impact on their business model will be greater than or equal to earlier disruptive technologies, and they’re optimistic about its potential, according to the recent TCS AI for Business Study. The democratization and availability of AI native resources is expected to improve GTM success rates, user experience, reduce spending on commercial off the shelf software/hardware (COTS) and operations.","AI, however, is not a plug-and-play technology with a one-size-fits-all strategy, as the TCS study shows. The findings from CMI executives reflect their varied approaches to AI — while some want to establish an enterprisewide AI strategy, perhaps upending current ways of working; others want to figure out how best to leverage AI to reap its benefit. About a fifth of the respondents say that they will continue to experiment with AI, and about a quarter plan to wait and see what their competitors do.","An image depicting varied AI adoption strategies in the CMI industry.","For the telecommunications industry, the advent of GenAI and shift in the operating model from telcos to techcos provides interesting opportunities to reimagine the telco value chain creating core product differentiation, enabling creation of new products and services, and thus, new monetization avenues. These also help in delivering superior customer experience along with an increase in customer lifetime value (CLV) while driving efficiency and resiliency.","In fact, 50% of financially overperforming “Pacesetter” telcos in the study are exploring how to use AI (both GenAI and established AI technologies) to support greater personalization to generate customer loyalty.","With the adoption of AI in their core commercial business and network infrastructure, telcos are moving from being just DSPs to AI-driven enterprises. The softwarisation of networks enables the application of AI to:","Real-world examples of autonomous networks leveraging AI","Verizon driving customer experience in the core network infused with AI-based intelligence for product differentiation","Comcast’s mission to leverage classic and GenAI to transform the cable business with a prime view into improving revenue. Applied AI infusing intelligence in core products such as connected homes, video entertainment, and residential connectivity products are a part of this initiative.","Similarly, AI has the potential to transform and reinvent the entire Media value chain from pre-production to distribution, and to other strategic areas such as product innovation, customer and content monetization, and experience management. For Media, personalization and targeted content recommendations using AI is one of the most valued use cases in driving better user engagement in streaming apps, news media (print and video) and social media. Companies like Disney are using AI to contextualize advertising for the Disney+ and Hulu streaming services. Foxtel in Australia, for instance, has been heavily investing in AI to lift sports fan engagement to the next level. Machine language models are able to identify when and how wickets fall in live cricket games, in real time, and letting fans know before it happens by recognizing patterns in player behavior based on past form and the live conditions of the pitch.","Large telcos with huge networks and loads of operational data are looking into powering GenAI models with their data to build Telco domain models for the industry. A global telco AI alliance (GTAA)was announced during MWC Barcelona 2024 where few telcos came together to establish a joint venture, through which the companies plan to develop Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically tailored to the needs of telecommunications companies. Meanwhile, Telcos are shifting from \"CSP/operator-defined products\" to \"customer-driven products\" in B2B2X.","Customer experience is a big focus area for telcos with use cases like:","1. Hyper-personalized product recommendations across multiple touchpoints","2. Bring more dynamism in pricing engines for real-time offer management","3. Drive more predictability in “win- back” campaigns and offer uptake maximization","4. Revenue assurance copilots","5. Preemptive churn analysis, proactive retentions & CLV maximization","6. Cognitive Business Network command centers driven through AI-led automation","Operators like Vodafone in the UK, EE (BT), Telstra and Telefonica are infusing core AI in driving customer experience in these aspects. According to the AI for Business Study, over a third (38%) of telco executives want customers to have more personalized, AI-driven interactions with their products and services .","A figure showing how CMI companies are leveraging AI for improving customer engagement","Another emerging opportunity for telcos is the monetization of AI, allowing telcos to resell infra and cloud services. Telcos have a unique advantage – the ability to use their network resources to set up and sell AI digital factory services (infrastructure needed to support AI applications) to enterprises as well as small and medium businesses to meet the growing demand for sovereign cloud / sovereign infrastructure.","Insights from TCS’ research reveals that of respondents from CMI reported that they are already exploring AI’s potential to increase personalization and contextualization, providing vastly more targeted, relevant and rewarding audience interactions.","As Media and Entertainment (M&E) organizations are increasingly moving their media content workflows and advertising ops workflows to the cloud, and are also exploring remote production in the cloud. AI/ML will play a significant role in automating, infusing intelligence to and streamlining these workflows. AI will be a key lever in packaging, bundling, and presenting content in various desired formats to drive customer interest and revenue opportunities. GenAI could also be used to deliver media product innovation through market intelligence and feedback on uptake from audience on their experience and engagement with the products. International Broadcasting Convention’s (IBC’s) recent accelerator programs have been experimenting with AI applications in media in areas such as using Unreal Engine and AI for smart remote production for real-time animation, auto-dubbing and colour grading, metadata management such as facial recognition in sports, to name a few.","Real-world examples","A compelling use case for the M&E industry is automated content generation using natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision algorithms, which generates both text and visuals. GenAI adds to opportunity areas in content creation, curation and personalized delivery through creativity-infused automation in use cases ranging from script writing, creating content summaries in any format from anywhere any-time, multi-lingual and multi-contextual localizations, content enrichment and moderation, sentiment analysis and monetization. While there is lot of debate on creative human capabilities versus AI, judicious use of GenAI in augmenting human creativity helps M&E companies to deepen content engagement and delivery. In fact, according to the AI for Business Study CMI report*, 64% of CMI executives say human creativity will be their company’s competitive advantage.","An image depicting most CMI executives believe that human creativity or strategic thinking will remain their company's competitive advantage","NBC Universal is tapping into AI to automate buying across linear and streaming TV. The company is launching a new AI-infused product called One Platform Total Audience or AI-powered Total Audience, which automates planning across its linear channels and streaming platforms via a single audience-based buy—and potentially give its legacy networks a boost in the process.","Accelerating the journey to AI maturity","AI native enterprises can chart their path toward maturity while identifying value stream interventions, AI hotspots and a way to interlace reusable AI capabilities with existing transformation journeys across the sector. As the study shows, CMI executives are prioritizing AI productivity gains but, at the same time, over a quarter of respondents are starting to view AI more as a quality-enabler than as a productivity-enhancer. In fact, improving quality along with driving innovation may prove to be where companies see the most value from AI over the long term. Whatever their business priority, their success will depend on their ability to transform into AI-native enterprises.","To succeed in an AI-driven world, CSPs need a holistic approach towards building their AI adoption strategy that draws upon the strengths of other initiatives and disciplines such as augmented SRE, DevOps, Hybrid FinOps and applied in the context of autonomous business and integrate it while shaping the North Star architecture and the capability evolution roadmap for program shaping and planning.","Use a best practice framework that starts with business value chain analysis to ensure success of AI programs.","TCS’ Thought Leadership Institute conducted a double-blind study of approximately 1,272 senior executives with P&L responsibilities in 12 industry sectors across Asia, Europe, Nordics, LATAM, North America, and the United Kingdom and Ireland, with respondents having annual revenue of $5 billion to $100 billion.

So, how can organizations create the right people experience?","Framework for change","We recommend a framework for a technology-led people experience transformation that cuts across all dimensions of work and workplace, and helps organizations become future-ready enterprises.","Our framework focuses on personalization, authenticity, responsiveness, transparency, and simplicity—value propositions that every HR function and organization needs to attract and retain employees.","The framework also identifies seven key areas that people-centric enterprises need to focus on to deliver on these value propositions and address the needs and aspirations of employees.

As shown in figure 1, each key area is mapped to a corresponding subset of functions and capabilities that are needed to enable a sustainable people experience for the current and future needs of employees and organizations.","A depiction of the functions and capabilities needed to create a sustainable people experience—one that focuses on meeting the current and future needs of employees and organizations. Apart from five things—personalization, authenticity, responsiveness, transparency, and simplicity—it highlights seven key tenets of people experience: accessibility, connections, growth and development, simplified windows of engagement and collaboration, communications, intuitive intelligence, and well-being.","The framework aligns well with both current and emerging trends in reimagining people experience. While the framework shows the path organizations can take, we believe focusing on two sets of levers—people and technology-driven change—can accelerate this journey and ensure a successful transformation.","People-led journey","A reimagination of the people experience needs to be people-led as well as technology-driven.","A people-led reimagination requires the following:","Tech-driven change","Technology must assist employees throughout their work and be available when needed.","Technology plays a major role in a people experience transformation. A connected tech architecture can provide employees with the necessary tools, resources, and support they need to accomplish their goals. Depending on their needs, priorities, and appetite for change, organizations can choose from and leverage a variety of tools and technologies to elevate people experience. We believe enterprises embarking on a tech-driven people experience transformation need to focus on the following:","Organizations must evaluate solution options, technologies, and architecture for the functional and technical capabilities needed. Also, the focus should be on using technology to reduce friction but not at the cost of losing the human touch where it makes a difference. Technology should be used only where it makes sense to use it, maximizing digital dexterity while minimizing technology friction in consumer grade solutions.","No one size fits all","There is no ‘one size fits all’ approach for a people experience transformation.","With the extent and nature of how a transformation can vary between organizations—some taking a big-bang approach while others opt for a more incremental approach—each transformation requires a unique strategy. However, by treating employees as ambassadors and empowering them with hyper-personalized policies, and tools and resources for flexible, purposeful work-life management, organizations can create meaningful employee experiences. This would deliver value for all—not just for employees, but for the organization, customers, and shareholders as well.","People experience transformation starts with a strategic leadership vision and involves a reimagination of the employee journey from human-centric perspectives. It entails defining blueprints encompassing the people, policy, process, functional and technology capabilities; identifying technologies and solutions to build the required capabilities or address gaps; and implementing a road map of initiatives. It calls for consulting and problem-solving to define and execute a people experience strategy; a design thinking-led reimagination and personalization of employee journeys; defining the technology architecture; solution mapping and implementation; and agile transformation management. An ecosystem of alliance partners is required as well, including providers of the best-in-class digital workplace and collaboration tools, talent intelligence, metaverse solutions, and next-gen learning platforms. Enterprises should factor in these things before embarking on their people experience transformation and choose trusted partners with relevant experience to accelerate the journey.","A TCS-Josh Bersin Academy study shows that ‘irresistible organizations’ with great employee experience are:","times more likely to engage and retain employees.","times more likely to delight customers.","times more likely to innovate effectively.","About the authors","How Digital Workplaces Can Improve Business Results","How empathy can improve performance management","TCS Accelerated Adoption Approach for Microsoft 365 Copilot","Intelligent workforce and wage planning for optimized SG&A expenses","Transformation starts here","Looking to turn purpose into action?","We use cookies to give you the best possible experience on our website."]}}]},{"tabname":"Case studies","tabcards":[{"text":"Vodafone UK Collaborates with TCS to Enhance Business Agility, CX","href":"https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/industries/communications-media-information-services/video/vodafone-uk-collaborates-tcs-enhance-business-agility","pagecontent":{"title":"Vodafone UK Collaborates with TCS to Enhance Business Agility, CX","metaDescription":" Vodafone UK and TCS’ partnership redefined technology in business, improving IT efficiency, strengthening cybersecurity, and enhancing CX.

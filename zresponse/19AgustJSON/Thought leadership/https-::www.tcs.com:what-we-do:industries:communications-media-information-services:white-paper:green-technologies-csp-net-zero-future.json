With a drastic surge in traffic across the radio access network (RAN) from mobile and fixed wireless access applications, this shift will curb operational expenses while ensuring optimal network performance."]},{"heading":"Sustainable pursuits","content":["Telcos need to focus on designing customizable, energy-efficient solutions.","Every communications service provider must navigate the challenge of balancing cost optimization with investment in 5G technology in an environment of economic uncertainty, fluctuating revenue prospects, and escalating data traffic. On one hand, 5G has enabled the rapid rise of streaming services and e-services, and on the other, it has called for increased focus on data privacy and cybersecurity.","Pressure from regulators, customers, employees, and investors to establish environmentally responsible operations and lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remain core challenges for CSPs. In Europe, some telcos have incorporated renewable energy sources to mitigate GHG emissions; however, curbing the ever-growing energy demand of their networks has proven tricky.","While renewable energy like solar and wind power is crucial for the reduction of carbon emissions, sourcing such energy can be challenging. Unlike large data center operators, CSPs construct networks in proximity to their customers, regardless of the availability of nearby renewable energy sources.","To achieve net zero under these circumstances, telcos must:","Implement dynamic resource allocation: Dynamic adjustment of power usage and resource allocation based on demand and network conditions is crucial. This approach reduces operational costs with minimal impact on the customer experience, incorporating strategies such as sleep mode, resource deactivation, traffic rebalancing, and conducting what-if experiments to gauge the impact on customer service experience.","Prioritize RAN improvement: Focusing on research and innovation in product development can enhance power utilization in the RAN solution portfolio, thereby contributing to energy savings.","Use AI-ML solutions and open frameworks: Implementing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions, along with open frameworks, offers a customizable approach for energy savings tailored to the telecom industry and business requirements.","Ensure energy efficiency: Implementing smart and efficient solutions, such as high gain antennas and passive measures, can enhance transmission efficiency and reduce power transmitter energy consumption, considering both base load and variable load improvements.","Manage long-term energy consumption: Utilizing standardized APIs in AI-ML tooling and platforms enhances the ability to efficiently trade off traffic transmission in line with customer demand, contributing to effective energy consumption management in the long run."]},{"heading":"Reaching net zero","content":["By adopting renewable energy sources, implementing energy-efficient technologies, and optimizing network infrastructure, telcos are racing toward net zero.","Through investments in green technologies, such as solar and wind power, many telecom companies are working to reduce their carbon footprint while continually upgrading their networks to ensure energy efficiency. These efforts reflect a growing understanding within the industry that sustainability is not just corporate responsibility but also a crucial element in meeting the changing demands of consumers in the long run.","Telecom companies are taking various measures, including the adoption of circular principles to encourage network equipment suppliers to design products with reuse, repair, and re-manufacturing in mind, promoting recycling of products and materials."]},{"heading":"Go green","content":["In a post-pandemic world, 5G, cloud, and edge technologies allowed the world to migrate swiftly and seamlessly to virtual connectivity with a click.","With ease of access, traffic has steadily grown for communications service providers, making sustainability a key focus area for this industry. Telcos are now working to minimize environmental impact, finding energy-efficient ways of managing networks, designing scalable energy-saving technologies, and promoting circular devices and renewable energy sources. Future-ready CSPs must continue incorporating sustainability into their core operating business models while prioritizing responsible supply chain practices and adopting transparent reporting mechanisms on sustainability efforts."]},{"heading":"About the author","content":["Sujatha Gopal is the chief technology officer (CTO) of the Communications, Media, and Information Services business unit of Tata Consultancy Services.

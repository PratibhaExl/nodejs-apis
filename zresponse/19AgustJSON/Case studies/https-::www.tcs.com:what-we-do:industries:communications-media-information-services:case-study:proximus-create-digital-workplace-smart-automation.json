To minimize the dependence on manual coordination in multi-partner projects, Proximus wanted to automate their cost settlement process.","TCS’ solution allowed for seamless integration of Proximus’ cost settlement process, addressing architectural and data quality challenges, and maximizing the advantages within their telecommunications planning, engineering, and construction (PEC) processes.","Due to TCS’ long-standing strategic partnership with the client, our expertise in the planning, engineering, and construction (PEC) domain, and proven experience in IT transformation, Proximus chose TCS as its partner in this strategic initiative."]},{"heading":"Challenge","content":["Proximus wanted to stop expense overspill resulting from the settlement of costs in a multi-partner ecosystem.","The company’s existing planning, engineering, and construction (PEC) network infrastructure could not accommodate the higher volumes of data needed for multi-partner projects. The various tools involved in the legacy PEC process created a complex landscape, especially in a collaborative setup. With multiple partners onboard, dividing costs across organizations required immense collation and calculation across categories. Manually loading this data onto the PEC infrastructure led to full-time equivalent (FTE) loss and data quality issues.","TCS’ smart automation solution and integration for synergized cost calculation enabled Proximus to modernize downstream processes with accurate financial data.","Excellent implementation by TCS with a perfect blend of contextual knowledge, technical expertise, and agility.","Bernard Raquet"]},{"heading":"Solution","content":["TCS enabled smart automation, mitigating data quality issues.","Proximus wanted an end-to-end solution that can be scaled to facilitate collaboration and integration with synergized platforms across Belgium.","This became a major challenge as it required working with an external cost settlement tool and comprehending the language of the external platforms.","TCS designed a facade layer architecture to effectively translate the data from the external platforms which support seamless scalability, enabling data collaboration. TCS introduced smart automation to efficiently identify any data quality issues during the data load process and automatically rectify or suggest possible methods of correction. This not only reduced manual workload, but also elevated the quality of their reporting outcomes.","The solution led to a remarkable enhancement in the quality of data, and generation of customized reports specifically for the finance team. These output files were seamlessly integrated into the project executive system (PXS) finance systems, effectively mitigating the issue of cost leakage."]},{"heading":"Outcome","content":["Automation and smart design have ensured seamless digitalization of synergized financial processes at Proximus.","TCS’ solution ensured that:","With automation in place, growth in productivity of the employees increased by >50%","With efficient data quality handling using smart automation, errors came down by >90%","Proximus had full visibility of the synergized orders and costs"]},{"cards":[]}]}
